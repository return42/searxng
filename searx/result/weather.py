.. admonition:: data model is still under construction

   This weather data model is in a very early stage.  Declare inheritance of
   weather data types and assemble a result type for a result item of a
   weather-engine needs far more experience.  We should not finish the model
   before we have more than one weather engine.

   In the mean time the weather return item is described in :ref:`engine weather
   media types`.


TypedDict declarations
----------------------

Declared data types for `dict` types returned by weather engines:

   :caption: Weather type that sums weather condition for a specific time period.

.. inheritance-diagram:: WeatherInstantType
   :caption: Type of weather data valid for a specific point in time.

.. inheritance-diagram:: TemperatureType
   :caption: Type of thermodynamic temperature.
