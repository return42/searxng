# Privacy Policy

We provide this information for SearXNG's instances installed on servers in the
Economic European Area (EEA) or outside the EEA for those who consult the
{{link('SearXNG website', 'search')}} or submit queries.  So that you know, this
information applies only to this SearXNG instance **and not to other websites
the user may consult through links**.

When data subjects or SearXNG providers are in the EEA, the [EU Regulation
2016/679 (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN)
applies.

Indeed, according to Article 3(2) of the GDPR, we underline whether SearXNG's
instances are installed on servers, not in the EEA, but the service is offered
to users in the EEA, Regulation 2016/679 applies.

> Article 3
> Territorial scope

## Data controller

The data controller is `{name of the instance maintaner}` - (`{maintainer's
email}`).

## How does SearXNG protect privacy?

SearXNG protects the privacy of its users in multiple ways regardless of the
type of instance (private or public). Removal of private data from search
requests comes in three forms:

1. Removal of private data from requests going to search services.

2. Not forwarding anything from third-party services through search services
   (e.g., advertisement).

3. Removal of private data from requests going to the result pages.  Removing
   private data means not sending cookies to external search engines and
   generating a random browser profile for every request. Thus, it does not
   matter if a public or private instance handles the request because it is
   anonymized in both cases. IP addresses will be the IP of the
   instance. However, the SearXNG admin can configure it to use a proxy or Tor.
   [Result proxy](https://github.com/asciimoo/morty) is supported, too. SearXNG
   does not serve ads or tracking content, unlike most search services. So
   private data is not forwarded to third parties who might monetize it. Besides
   protecting users from search services, referring pages and search queries are
   hidden from visited result pages.

## What's happened when you send a query through a SearXNG instance?

We reproduce the steps below:

1. You send your query from a SearXNG instance;

2. The SearXNG instance sends your query to the search engines set by default on
   every specific SearXNG instance (All the SearXNG instances (private and
   public) might differ because it depends on the settings chosen by the admin.
   However, you can view and modify what the engines set by default via
   {{link('Preferences => Engines', 'preferences')}}).

3. The search engines (for instance, DDG or Qwant) that receive your query
   elaborate on it and send the response to the SearXNG instance.

## Is your data or personal data transmitted to search engines?

**The answer is NO, and precisely:**

1. **None of your data nor personal data is transmitted** from the SearXNG instance except:

  - Your query;
  - The language you selected on the SearXNG instance;
  - The technical parameters are needed to form the same query.

2. **No metadata is transmitted**.

**In the end, only**:

- your query,
- the language you selected on the SearXNG instance and
- the technical parameters needed to form the same query

are transmitted to search engines.

## Can the search engines see your data or install cookies or other stuff on your browser?

**The answer is: No, they cannot.**

Indeed, the search engines (for example, DDG or qwant) that receive your query
through the SearXNG instance:

1. Do not know from where (IP or location) your query comes and see your IP
   since they are talking only with the SearXNG instance;

2. Acquire only the IP of the SearXNG instance you used for your query.

3. Cannot send your browser cookies or other data to track you since the search
   engines that receive your query are only connected to the SearXNG instance
   and not your web browser.

## What data is collected

This SearXNG instance receives only your IP but does not collect it.

**Each user is responsible for the content they intend to submit as a query**.

### Who can access the data, and for what activities?

None neither the server administrator (instance) can access Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) nor data of the queries but only - for technical
needs - system logs without the possibility of retrieving any personal data
anyway.

## The purposes of the processing

When data subjects or SearXNG providers are in the EEA, the GDPR applies.
Still, the purpose is to provide all access to the SearXNG instance by allowing
users to submit queries and read and consult the search results.

Furthermore, the purposes are also related to server maintenance and system and
application upgrades.

The optional, explicit, and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the
addresses indicated on the footer of this site involves the acquisition of the
sender's address necessary for the replies and any other personal data contained
in the message.  These data are processed to respond to messages sent and handle
related requests. Failure to provide personal data for communications with us or
send requests will prevent evading them. We store data for the time strictly
necessary for the purposes related to data processing.

## Legal basis for the processing

When data subjects or SearXNG providers are in the EEA, the GDPR applies.
Still, the processing of personal data is based on consent - according to
Article 6, par. 1, letter a) of EU Regulation 2016/679 - expressed by the user
by browsing this website, choosing the preferences, and submitting queries, thus
accepting this information.

Consent is optional, and the user can withdraw at any time by request sent by
email to `{maintainer's email}`ยก, specifying that, in this case, whether the
user does not consent, they cannot consult this website.

Regarding server maintenance and system and application upgrades, the legal
basis is the legitimate interest according to Article 6, letter f) of the EU
Regulation 2016/679.

The processing of personal data is necessary to pursue the data controller's
legitimate interest in providing information about studies and research,
according to article 6, par. 1, letter f) of EU Regulation 2016/679, in
compliance with the provisions of the same Regulation.

## Cookies

The only cookies are only **functional ones** and, therefore, no profiling or
tracking activities.

**Thus, this site does not use cookies other than functional cookies solely for
the functional purposes described above, and their installation does not require
the user's consent**.

## Data recipients

We don't communicate personal data collected from this website following its
consultation to recipients or categories of recipients.

## Period for storing personal data

This website does not collect nor store user data.

## Transferring personal data to a third country or international organization

When data subjects or SearXNG providers are in the EEA, the GDPR applies.
Still, the data controller, the administrator of SearXNG's instance, does not
transfer any personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if SearXNG
is installed on the server located within the European Economic Area.

## Security measures

The SearXNG instance maintainer adopts appropriate security measures to prevent
unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of
data.  Your data in the communication session with this website are protected by
a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that uses a cryptographic presentation
protocol, encrypting the information.

## Data subjects' rights

When data subjects or SearXNG providers are in the EEA, the GDPR applies.
Still, users (data subjects) who access the service provided by this instance
may exercise the rights according to Articles 15 to 22 of EU Regulation
2016/679.  You can lodge all requests to exercise these rights by writing to
`{maintainer's email}`.

## Right to lodge a complaint

When data subjects or SearXNG providers are in the EEA, the GDPR applies.
Still, whether a data subject considers that the processing of personal data
relating to them as performed via this SearXNG instance infringes the
Regulation, they have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent
Supervisory Authority (Data Protection Authority) according to Article 77 of the
EU Regulation 2016/679.
