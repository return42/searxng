  <h2>Why use it?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      SearXNG may not offer you as personalised results as Google, but it doesn't
      generate a profile about you.
    </li>
    <li>
      SearXNG doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
      third party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
    </li>
    <li>
      SearXNG is free software, the code is 100% open and you can help to make
      it better.  See more on <a href="{{ get_setting('brand.git_url', '')
      }}">SearXNG sources</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise
    believe in digital freedom, make SearXNG your default search engine or run
    it on your own server
  </p>

  <h2>Technical details - How does it work?</h2>

  <p>
    SearXNG is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine">metasearch engine</a>,
    inspired by the <a href="https://beniz.github.io/seeks/">seeks project</a>.

    It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other
    platforms without storing search data. Queries are made using a POST request
    on every browser (except Chromium-based browsers*).  Therefore they show up
    in neither our logs, nor your url history. In the case of Chromium-based
    browser users there is an exception: searx uses the search bar to perform GET
    requests.

    SearXNG can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as
    the default search engine.
  </p>

  <h2 id='add to browser'>How to set as the default search engine?</h2>

  <p>
    SearXNG supports <a href="https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md">OpenSearch</a>.
    For more information on changing your default search engine, see your browser's documentation:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox">Firefox</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028574/microsoft-edge-change-the-default-search-engine">Microsoft Edge</a></li>
    <li>Chromium-based browsers <a href="https://www.chromium.org/tab-to-search">only add websites that the user navigates to without a path.</a>
  </ul>
